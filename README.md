# IPFS Notes

This demo is meant to help me/you get feel for running an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) node in the browser, as well as creating and displaying IPFS data.

The app creates a node that's connected to the IPFS network, and allows the user to create a note that's saved as an IPFS object with a hash address which is accessible to any node on the network.

## Run the app

```bash
> npm i
> node server.js
```
